# Warehouse Module for ERP System
This project is a web application built with Flask and Flask-Admin to manage the warehouse module of an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system. It enables users to manage inventory, process stock movements, and track goods entering and leaving the warehouse. The application supports three roles: warehouseman, controller, and admin. Depending on their permissions, users can perform various activities within the system.

The system's login page is located at /login, and individual views are available under /user_role/appropriate_view.
